# Confusely üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: hussain huzefa


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Hussain Huzefa - CE Vadakara

### Project Description
The Useless Masterpiece: A peer-to-peer chat application built on a custom-designed, intentionally flawed network protocol. The maker submitted a detailed, RFC-style document for their "Unreliable Conversation Protocol" (UCP). In practice, the app takes your message, breaks it into packets, and then intentionally drops 30% of them while reordering the rest before sending them. A message like, "Hey, let's meet for chai at 5 PM," might arrive as, "meet 5 PM Hey, for at."

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Real chat offers a bridge . thats the problem, we aim to break the bridge

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
to break bridge and make communication impossible

## Technical Details
For Software
Languages used:

JavaScript (ES6+)

Frameworks used:

Express.js (Backend)

React.js (Frontend)

Libraries used:

socket.io (Server real-time communication)

socket.io-client (Client real-time communication)

cors (Handle cross-origin requests)

nodemon (Auto-restart server during development)

Tools used:

Node.js

npm (Node Package Manager)

VS Code (IDE)

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
[commands]
1. mkdir chat-app
   cd chat-app

2. backend
mkdir server
cd server
npm init -y
npm install express socket.io cors
npm install --save-dev nodemon

3. frontend
cd ..
npx create-react-app client
cd client
npm install socket.io-client




# Run
[commands]
backend
cd server
npx nodemon index.js

frontend:
cd client
npm start

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
